Limitations of Point Cloud Decoders

- need a lot of points for details
- consume much GPU memories
- can't change the number of points
- Point Cloud need to be converted to other presentations

- Take the shape latent vector as an additional condition input.
- Feature vector + Point coordinate = NN's input

- Add another NN that predicts the parameters of the implicit function.
- This is called meta function.

- A set of 2D patches.





Implicit functions are agnostic to the resolution of shapes.

 Implicit functions are also flexible to the topology of shapes.

But the inference time is much more because we need to sample as much points as we need.



Volume occupancies and shape latent code have different behaviors in interpolation.



Implicit representation also has applications in Image / LiDAR super-resolution tasks.
