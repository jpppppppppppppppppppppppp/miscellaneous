Two-View Geometry. How to compute the relative camera matrix from two views, given the 2D point correspondence.

Epipolar Geometry.

The degree of freedom is 7 so there is an 8-Point Algorithm: given at least 8 pairs of corresponding points, than we can find the fundamental matrix, such that $x'Fx=0$.

Stack rows with $(x',x)$ pairs, and make a homogenous linear system: $AF=0$.

If matrix $A$ has rank 8, then $F$ is the null vector of $A$.

If matrix $A$ has rank greater than 8, which means the sample pairs have noise, we can use SVD to find $F$ minimizing $\|AF\|$.



The limitation of SfM is the 3D output is a set of keypoints, which cannot be rendered.
