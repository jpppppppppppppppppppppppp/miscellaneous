Personalization and Privacy

e.g., a rare name of a person can be remembered by SD.

- Copyrighted images.
- Company IPs/ logos. 
- Artist styles of living artists.



Subject-Driven Controllable Generation: Visual defined subject and text driven task

DreamBooth: using class-specific prior preservation loss (A dog & A [V] dog)

Imagic: First reconstruction text embedding, then use this to fine-tune the model, then interpolation and generation. But not works very ideally

ComFusion: Instance Fidelity and Scene Fidelity.

Impossible Triangles: High Quality Samples.	Mode Diversity.	Fast Sampling.

1+2 Diffusion. 1+3 GAN. 2+3 VAE / Normalizing Flows.



GAN trained on distribution loss with clearer images but mode collapse and limited diversity.

Diffusion trained on point-wise loss with maintained diversity but with blur images.

Diffusion model can be trained on large dataset.



SD can remember what Musk looks like, but a classifier cannot remember it.



How to Preserve Privacy?

- Remove and retraining. expensive.
- Maximize loss. training maximize loss
  - training diverges
  - nearby concept changed
- Distribution matching: overwrite with a super-class

Concept Ablation
